# Rtifact
A VR world experience for NFT exchanges and personal collection presentation


## Project Definition  
Rtifact is an interactive VR Metaverse platform for NFTs and digitally owned products which transforms the experience of NFT ownership from on-desk to a new virtual interactive world.

Itâ€™s like a giant digital museum or personal hangar where you will be able to roam and interact in the NFT marketplaces through VR, view your own digital products in your personalised virtual hangar and products of other people in their personalised presentation spaces which are personally customised by the users allowing every experience to be unique.

In this VR platform, you will be able to buy and sell NFTs, create and put up for auction your NFTs and interact with other users of the platform. Everything will be happening in a digitally created virtual world where every kind of fantasy is possible. You will be able to perform every operation that you can perform on NFT marketplaces from your computer, but this time the experience is enhanced with VR and surreal.
